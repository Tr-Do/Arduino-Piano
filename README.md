Improvised version of SIMON Game with Arduino


Components:
- Arduino Uno R3
- Momentary Push Buttons (user input)
- Buzzer (sound output)
- Resistors & Capacitors (circuit stability and pull-up resistors)


Functionality:
Arduino generates tones via the buzzer, each linked to a button.
The sequence is similar to a piano
C++ code is modified to generate different frequency respectively
